# RAG Setup Playbook

This playbook walks through the minimum setup needed to make the current Firebase + Supabase RAG MVP work end-to-end.

**Internbot:** After deploy, set `RAG_SERVICE_URL` in the [Internbot](https://github.com/giatinhuynh/Internbot) backend to this service’s function base URL (see [README](../README.md#integration-with-internbot)).

For the feature overview, see [RAG-MVP.md](RAG-MVP.md). For architecture details, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md). For canonical variable definitions, see [ENV-VARS.md](ENV-VARS.md).

## Prerequisites

You need:

- a Firebase project for auth/backend hosting
- a Supabase project with `pgvector` support
- a Gemini API key
- local project dependencies installed with `pnpm install`

## 1. Configure environment variables

Set the Firebase and frontend variables described in [ENV-VARS.md](ENV-VARS.md).

For the live RAG MVP, the backend also needs:

- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- optional `GEMINI_EMBEDDING_MODEL`

Minimum backend `.env` example:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
GEMINI_EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-004
```

Without these, the app may still start, but retrieval and ingestion will not work end-to-end.

## 2. Apply the Supabase schema

Apply `backend/supabase/schema.sql` to your Supabase project.

This creates:
- `knowledge_documents`
- `knowledge_chunks`
- the vector index for embeddings
- the `match_knowledge_chunks` RPC function used by the backend retriever

Until this SQL is applied, ingestion and retrieval requests will fail or return no useful data.

## 3. Ensure a Firebase user has the admin claim

Knowledge management is restricted to users whose Firebase token contains:

```json
{ "admin": true }
```

Set this claim for the user who will access `/knowledge`.

The exact method depends on how you manage Firebase Admin access in your environment. The important part is that the signed-in user’s decoded token includes `admin: true`.

## 4. Start the app locally

Use the project’s standard commands:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

If you are using emulators, follow the existing local setup in the project README.

## 5. Sign in and open the knowledge page

1. Sign in through the app
2. Navigate to `/knowledge`
3. Confirm the page loads successfully

If you get a 403 response from the knowledge API, the admin claim is missing or not reflected in the current token.

## 6. Seed domain knowledge (recommended)

Use the one-time CLI pipeline (no admin UI required). Ensure `backend/.env` has `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, and `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

### Optional: scrape public RMIT pages

```bash
pnpm --filter backend scrape:rmit-pages
```

Review extracted text under `backend/data/scraped/` before ingesting.

### Ingest manifest (FAQ sections, coordinators, scraped pages)

```bash
pnpm --filter backend ingest:knowledge -- --replace-feature faq-rag
```

This reads `backend/data/knowledge-manifest.json`, splits `faq-internship-students-cleaned.txt` by section, ingests coordinator contacts (Alessio Bonti, Golnoush Abaei), and includes scraped files when present. `--replace-feature` deletes existing `faq-rag` rows first.

Manual API ingest (`POST /api/knowledge/documents`) remains available for admins; the `/knowledge` dashboard page is currently disabled.

## 7. Verify retrieval in chat

1. Open `/assistant?feature=faq-rag`
2. Ask: **Who is my course coordinator?** — expect names, emails, and clickable sources
3. Ask: **How long must the internship be?** — expect FAQ content with source excerpts and links
4. Confirm the response includes an expanded **Sources** panel (open by default) with excerpts and **Open source** links

If the answer appears but no sources are shown, retrieval is not being used successfully yet.

## 8. Suggested verification checklist

Use this checklist after setup:

- [ ] `pnpm --filter backend ingest:knowledge -- --replace-feature faq-rag` completes without errors
- [ ] `/assistant?feature=faq-rag` returns an answer with HTTPS `sourceUrl` values (not `local://`)
- [ ] coordinator questions mention Alessio Bonti and Golnoush Abaei with emails
- [ ] the chat UI shows source excerpts and clickable links
- [ ] an unrelated question does not crash the chat flow

## Troubleshooting

### Missing environment variables

Symptoms:
- ingestion fails during embedding or Supabase calls
- chat answers without sources

Checks:
- verify `SUPABASE_URL`
- verify `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- verify `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- verify the backend process picked up the updated env file

### No admin claim

Symptoms:
- `/knowledge` API returns 403
- document creation is blocked despite being signed in

Checks:
- confirm the Firebase user has `admin: true`
- refresh the session/token after setting the claim

### Schema not applied

Symptoms:
- Supabase calls fail
- ingestion writes fail
- retrieval returns database errors

Checks:
- verify `backend/supabase/schema.sql` was run against the correct project
- verify the `match_knowledge_chunks` function exists
- verify the `knowledge_documents` and `knowledge_chunks` tables exist

### Empty retrieval results

Symptoms:
- chat replies but `sources` is empty

Checks:
- confirm at least one `faq-rag` document was ingested
- confirm chunk rows exist in `knowledge_chunks`
- confirm embeddings were written
- confirm the question is actually related to the seeded content

### Gemini failures

Symptoms:
- ingestion fails while creating embeddings
- chat fails during generation

Checks:
- verify `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- verify the configured model names are valid for your account
- inspect backend logs for provider errors
