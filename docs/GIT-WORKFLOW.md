# Git Workflow

This project uses **Gitflow**. All branch management is automated via Claude Code skills.

## Branch Structure

```
main         ← production (protected, deploys automatically)
  ↑
develop      ← integration (protected, CI runs on every push)
  ↑
feature/*    ← new features (branched from develop)
release/*    ← release prep (branched from develop)
hotfix/*     ← urgent production fixes (branched from main)
```

## Branch Naming

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Feature | `feature/{kebab-case}` | `feature/invoice-pdf-export` |
| Hotfix | `hotfix/{kebab-case}` | `hotfix/auth-token-expiry` |
| Release | `release/{semver}` | `release/1.3.0` |

## Workflow

### New feature
```
/git-feature → creates feature/* → PR to develop → merge → delete branch
```

### Production fix
```
/git-hotfix → creates hotfix/* from main → PR to main → merge → back-merge to develop → tag
```

### Release
```
/git-release → creates release/* → version bump → PR to main → merge → tag → back-merge to develop
```

## Commit Messages (Conventional Commits)

The `commit-msg` hook enforces this format:

```
type(scope): description

Examples:
feat: add invoice PDF export
fix(auth): handle token expiry on refresh
docs: update Firestore schema for invoices
refactor(backend): extract auth middleware
test: add integration tests for health route
chore: upgrade firebase-admin to v13
```

**Types:** `feat` · `fix` · `docs` · `style` · `refactor` · `test` · `chore` · `build` · `ci` · `perf` · `revert`

## Merge Strategy

| Direction | Strategy | Why |
|-----------|----------|-----|
| `feature/*` → `develop` | Squash merge | Clean linear history on develop |
| `release/*` → `main` | Merge commit | Preserve release history |
| `hotfix/*` → `main` | Merge commit | Preserve fix history |
| `main` → `develop` (back-merge) | Merge commit | Bring hotfix back to develop |

## Release Rule

Only **one** `release/*` branch may exist at a time. Complete or abandon the current release before starting another — concurrent releases deploy to the same staging environment and would overwrite each other.

If a production fix is needed while a release is in staging, use `hotfix/*` instead (branches from `main`, bypasses staging).

## Protected Branches

`main` and `develop` are protected — no direct pushes. All changes go through pull requests.

CI must pass before merge:
- Lint + typecheck
- Unit tests
- Secret scan (gitleaks)
